Interests 
1. Very interested when it comes to Call of Duty esports. Used to compete back in high school. Not so much anymore due to school.
2. Love going out to get a drink with friends but during these times it's a lot harder to.
3. On the side I like to learn different coding languages. During the recent summer I was self learning python.

Technical Background

I've been coding for about 2 years now. I first learned how to code at GRCC using Ruby. Then when I transferred over to Grand Valley last year I learned about Java for the entire year. Then during the recent summer I learned the basics of python but have no applied that knowledge to any project yet. Now I'm about to learn C Sharp for the term project.
